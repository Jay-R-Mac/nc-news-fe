# nc-news-fe


This project entails a hosted application enabling us to interact with data stored in an SQL database through an API. The application is built using node.js and React.

The primary function of this application is to deliver news articles, allowing for sorting and customization. Additionally, users can access and manage comments associated with each article, including the option to add and delete comments if they are the owner. Furthermore, articles can be viewed and filtered by topic.
